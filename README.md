# Load Testing Project

The objective of this project was to build an "API" that returns current date/time in a JSON format. Additionally, there will be a test application which queries the "API" X times per second which will record `success`, `failure`, `and TTLB(Time to Last Byte)`.

### Instructions to run Application

1. Clone the repository to your local system and change directory into the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bqly520/load_testing_project.git
cd load_testing_project
```

2. Assuming that you already have Docker CLI installed, run the following command.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Example of hitting the API (with screenshots)

4. Example of using the test application (with screenshots)

5. Takeaways(?)

### Docker Learning
```bash
# Building the docker image with a tag 'date-api'
docker build -t date-api .

# Run the docker image, -d(detaching) for running in the background
docker run -d -p 7777:7777 date-api

# Configuring multiple containers at the same time
docker-compose up

# List images
docker images

# Docker inspect displays loads of details on the resource
docker inspect <network> <container> <image>

# Remove images
docker rmi Image Image

# List containers
docker ps -a

# Remove containers
docker rm ID_or_Name

# Build one or many images,
docker-compose build
```

#### docker-compose
This file is basically the backbone of Docker-Compose as it contains all the information needed to run the desired services. These services can pretty much be anything you want, in this example Iâ€™ll only be running a container for the app itself and another container for the test app, but you could also have other services.


### Python Libraries

### CherryPy
CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time.
```bash
pip install CherryPy
```
